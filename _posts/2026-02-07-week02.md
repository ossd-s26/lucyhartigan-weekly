## Team Purple Check In

This week we got to start working on our first open source project in small groups. I've never made any sort of browser extension and I'm excited to get started! Collaborative work is an equally challenging and rewarding experience since things like experience, work style, and communication style can be differ for everyone.

I love the collaborative nature of group work and already have enjoyed getting to know my partners in an academic and personal setting. 

So far my group has been working through exploring various extensions, implementing small extensions with tutorials, and figuring out the best way to maintain an organized workflow for our own project.

Me and another groupmate both have recent experience with Javascript from taking AIT and have been able to help other groupmates with directory set up. It's great to see how open everyone on my team is to communication and collaboration! I'm excited to continue the partnership and see where our project will go. 

## My first Contribution to Open Street Map

I was looking through the Open Street Map of my hometown, Hoboken NJ, and noticed that my elementary and middle school was still labeled as the school that occupied our building before we moved there in 2010. I was able to update this listing as well as attach the schools wikipedia page as a source. It's exciting to see how I can contribute to keeping this map updated.
