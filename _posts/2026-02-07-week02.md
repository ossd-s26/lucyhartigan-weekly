## Team Purple Check In

This week we got to start working on our first open source project in small groups. I've never made any sort of browser extension and I'm excited to get started! Collaborative work is an equally challenging and rewarding experience since things like experience, work style, and communication can be hard.

I love the collaborative nature of group work and already have enjoyed getting to know my partners in an academic and personal setting.

So far my group has been working through exploring various extensions, implementing small extensions with tutorials, and figuring out the best way to maintain an organized workflow for our own project.

Me and another groupmate both have recent experience with Javascript and have been able to help other groupmates with directory set up. It's great to see how open everyone on my team is to communication and collaboration! I'm excited to continue the partnership and see where our project will go.
