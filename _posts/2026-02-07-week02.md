Make your blog post. Comment on the work with your team and progress you have made towards your first open source project (what are some problems the group is facing, what good things happened, how do you fit into the collaboration, what are your biggest contributions, were there any surprising things you discovered about yourself in the process of the group work)

## Team Purple Check In

This week we got to start working on our first open source project in small groups. I've never made any sort of browser extension and I'm excited to get started! Collaborative work is an equally challenging and rewarding experience since things like experience, work style, and communication can be hard.

I love the collaborative nature of group work and already have enjoyed getting to know my partners in an academic and personal setting.

So far my group has been working through exploring various extensions, implementing small extensions with tutorials, and figuring out the best way to maintain an organized workflow for our own project.

Me and another groupmate both have recent experience with Javascript and have been able to help other groupmates with directory set up. It's great to see how open everyone on my team is to communication and collaboration! I'm excited to continue the partnership and see where our project will go.
